A really simple solution would literally to have system.out.println(“1”), system.out.println(“2”), system.out.println(“fizz”), and so forth until we reach 17. Another possibility is to define n as an integer = 17 and then write the for loop and if/else statements corresponding to fizz buzz. It would not involve user input and therefore the import.java.util.Scanner would be deleted as would the Scanner keyboard. Then when compiled would just run for n=17 each time.
