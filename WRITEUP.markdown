<h3> Part 2 </h3>

A really simple solution would literally to have system.out.println(“1”), system.out.println(“2”), <br>
system.out.println(“fizz”), and so forth until we reach 17. Another possibility is to define n as an <br>
integer = 17 and then write the for loop and if/else statements corresponding to fizz buzz. It would <br>
not involve user input and therefore the import.java.util.Scanner would be deleted as would the Scanner <br>
keyboard. Then when compiled would just run for n=17 each time.<br>
